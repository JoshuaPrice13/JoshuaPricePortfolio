            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’ve been surrounded by computers for as long as I can remember. There’s even a photo of me as a toddler barely tall enough to reach the desk, clicking through puzzle games with a mouse. But my journey into the technical side of computing truly began when I started recreating my father’s calculator games — and quickly leveled up to building full 3D simulations on the desktop.</p>

            <p>Today, I'm pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Oklahoma State University, developing a strong foundation in software engineering with languages like Java, C++, and C#. I’ve worked on everything from drone controllers in Java to complete video games in Unity using C# — all while diving into advanced math like Vector Calculus.</p>

            <p>As a proud Native American, I'm passionate about representation in STEM. Through my involvement with the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, I aim to encourage and empower future Native students to pursue technical fields — just like I did.</p>
